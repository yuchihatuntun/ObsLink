## Classification of Memory Devices and Key Indicators

| Classification Criteria  | Type                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| By Read-Write Function   | Read-Write Memory               | Allows CPU to read and write data, used for temporary data storage during system operation.                                                                                    |
|                          | Read-Only Memory (ROM)          | CPU can only read pre-stored data in normal operation, used for storing **firmware** or **system boot programs**.                                                              |
| By Storage Medium        | Semiconductor Memory            | Stores information using the state of semiconductor circuits (e.g., flip-flops or capacitors), features fast access speed and small size, and is the main form of main memory. |
|                          | Magnetic Memory                 | Stores information using the magnetization direction of magnetic materials, has large capacity but relatively slow speed.                                                      |
| By Access Method         | Random Access Memory (RAM)      | The access time for any memory cell is the same, irrelevant to its physical location, which is the main feature of internal memory.                                            |
|                          | Sequential Access Memory        | Access time depends on the physical location of the data (e.g., tape, which requires rewinding), usually used for external memory.                                             |
| By Information Retention | Volatile Memory                 | Information is lost immediately after power failure (e.g., common RAM).                                                                                                        |
|                          | Permanent (Non-Volatile) Memory | Information is retained after power failure and does not require power to maintain (e.g., ROM, hard disk).                                                                     |
