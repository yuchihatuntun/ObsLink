description: Sequential Logic (including differences between sequential and combinational circuits, classification and principles of static/dynamic sequential cells, and bistable characteristics), timing parameters (setup time, hold time, etc.) and constraint formulas, as well as clock technologies (classification of digital system timing, definitions/impacts/improvement methods of clock skew and clock jitter, and clock system architectures such as H-tree networks and PLLs).
